    "## Data set\n",
    "This is a comma-separated data file consisting of the average monthly global temperature anomalies between the years 1880-2021. These temperatures are based on the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4), an estimate of global surface temperature change. Anomalies are defined relative to a base period of 1951-1980.\n",

    "### Asynchronous programming\n",
    "is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished.\n",

    "### CSV file\n",
    "A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields. \n",

    "\n",
    "### JSON file\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with diverse uses in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers. \n",

    "### Constructor\n",
    "Class constructors are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming in Python. They allow you to create and properly initialize objects of a given class, making those objects ready to use. Class constructors internally trigger Python’s instantiation process, which runs through two main steps: instance creation and instance initialization.\n",
