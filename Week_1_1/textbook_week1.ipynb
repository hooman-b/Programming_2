    "# Useful Principles and methods\n",
    "## Static code analysis\n",
    "Static code analysis is meant to be done without running or even compiling the code. It can be done using techniques as fgrep, but also just by glancing over the code, opening files and see how they interact with each other. Different, very professional techniques exist for these kinds of jobs, but for this small code base doing stuff by hand will suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metaclass\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass defines the behavior of certain classes and their instances. Not all object-oriented programming languages support metaclasses. Among those that do, the extent to which metaclasses can override any given aspect of class behavior varies. Metaclasses can be implemented by having classes be first-class citizens, in which case a metaclass is simply an object that constructs classes. Each language has its own metaobject protocol, a set of rules that govern how objects, classes, and metaclasses interact.\n",

    "## Design Patterns\n",
    "In software engineering, a software design pattern refers to a widely applicable and reusable solution for addressing common problems within a specific software design context. It is not a finalized design that can be directly translated into source or machine code. Instead, it serves as a description or template for resolving problems that can be utilized across various situations. Design patterns encapsulate formalized best practices that programmers can leverage to tackle typical challenges during application or system design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns have the potential to accelerate the development process by offering tried and tested development paradigms. When designing software, it is essential to address concerns that may only become apparent during later stages of implementation. Newly written code can often harbor concealed, subtle issues that may take time to identify but can lead to significant problems in the future. By reusing design patterns, these subtle issues can be prevented, enhancing code readability for programmers and architects who are familiar with these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns were initially classified into three distinct categories, each addressing a specific problem domain. Creational patterns empower developers to create objects in a controlled manner, based on specific criteria. Structural patterns focus on organizing classes and objects to form larger structures while introducing new functionalities. Lastly, behavioral patterns revolve around recognizing common communication patterns between objects and implementing them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these catagories, Creational design patterns are one that is used in the following exercises. creational design patterns refer to design patterns that address object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner that suits the given situation. The straightforward approach to object creation can lead to design issues or introduce unnecessary complexity. Creational design patterns effectively mitigate these concerns by providing mechanisms to control the process of object creation. some of the design patterns that belong to this catagory are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Factory Method: The Factory Method pattern involves defining an interface or base class for creating a single object, while allowing subclasses to determine the specific class instantiation. By employing the Factory Method, a class can delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Abstract Factory Method: The Abstract Factory pattern offers an interface or base class for creating families of interconnected or dependent objects without explicitly specifying their concrete classes. It allows for the creation of object families that adhere to a common interface or base class, enabling flexible and interchangeable usage throughout the application.\n",

    "## SOLID\n",
    "SOLID is an acronym that represents five fundamental design principles aimed at enhancing the understandability, flexibility, and maintainability of object-oriented designs. These principles serve as guidelines for developing robust and adaptable software architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID principles can be described briefly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Single-responsibility principle: \"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.\" In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Openâ€“closed principle: \"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Liskov substitution principle: \"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.\" See also design by contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interface segregation principle: \"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dependency inversion principle: \"Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.\"[Wikipedia]\n",

    "# Exercises\n",
    "in this part all the excersizes will be anwered.\n",
    "## Exercise 1: The factory\n",
    "1- What is a factory?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a factory is an object responsible for creating other objects. In a formal term, it refers to a function or method that returns objects of a varying class, from some method call, which is assumed to be \"new\". The factory pattern allows for dynamic object creation and provides flexibility in generating instances of varying classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, HsmrParserFactory.py is a factory that can create two different objects from two different classes called HsmrTextParser and HsmrPdfParser, and it is called by HsmrReportHandler.get_ccs_info(). \n",
    "\n",
    "This factory can build an object from different classes at a time; consequently, one can conclude that the utilized design pattern in this program is Factory Method pattern (based on Wikipedia description of different design patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Does the implementation of the factory method follow the Interface Segregation Principle?\n",
    "\n",
    "in general term and based on the following link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46512199/factory-method-pattern-solid\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method pattern, being a creational pattern, is primarily responsible for object creation. It is not directly associated with the Interface Segregation Principle. The Interface Segregation Principle focuses on designing lean and logically grouped interfaces, avoiding the creation of fat interfaces where clients are compelled to implement unnecessary methods. While the Factory Method pattern deals with object creation, the Interface Segregation Principle concerns the design and organization of interfaces to ensure clients have access to only the methods they require."
