    "# Useful Principles and methods\n",
    "## Static code analysis\n",
    "Static code analysis is meant to be done without running or even compiling the code. It can be done using techniques as fgrep, but also just by glancing over the code, opening files and see how they interact with each other. Different, very professional techniques exist for these kinds of jobs, but for this small code base doing stuff by hand will suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metaclass\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass defines the behavior of certain classes and their instances. Not all object-oriented programming languages support metaclasses. Among those that do, the extent to which metaclasses can override any given aspect of class behavior varies. Metaclasses can be implemented by having classes be first-class citizens, in which case a metaclass is simply an object that constructs classes. Each language has its own metaobject protocol, a set of rules that govern how objects, classes, and metaclasses interact.\n",

    "## Design Patterns\n",
    "In software engineering, a software design pattern refers to a widely applicable and reusable solution for addressing common problems within a specific software design context. It is not a finalized design that can be directly translated into source or machine code. Instead, it serves as a description or template for resolving problems that can be utilized across various situations. Design patterns encapsulate formalized best practices that programmers can leverage to tackle typical challenges during application or system design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns have the potential to accelerate the development process by offering tried and tested development paradigms. When designing software, it is essential to address concerns that may only become apparent during later stages of implementation. Newly written code can often harbor concealed, subtle issues that may take time to identify but can lead to significant problems in the future. By reusing design patterns, these subtle issues can be prevented, enhancing code readability for programmers and architects who are familiar with these patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns were initially classified into three distinct categories, each addressing a specific problem domain. Creational patterns empower developers to create objects in a controlled manner, based on specific criteria. Structural patterns focus on organizing classes and objects to form larger structures while introducing new functionalities. Lastly, behavioral patterns revolve around recognizing common communication patterns between objects and implementing them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these catagories, Creational design patterns are one that is used in the following exercises. creational design patterns refer to design patterns that address object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner that suits the given situation. The straightforward approach to object creation can lead to design issues or introduce unnecessary complexity. Creational design patterns effectively mitigate these concerns by providing mechanisms to control the process of object creation. some of the design patterns that belong to this catagory are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Factory Method: The Factory Method pattern involves defining an interface or base class for creating a single object, while allowing subclasses to determine the specific class instantiation. By employing the Factory Method, a class can delegate the responsibility of object instantiation to its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Abstract Factory Method: The Abstract Factory pattern offers an interface or base class for creating families of interconnected or dependent objects without explicitly specifying their concrete classes. It allows for the creation of object families that adhere to a common interface or base class, enabling flexible and interchangeable usage throughout the application.\n",

    "## SOLID\n",
    "SOLID is an acronym that represents five fundamental design principles aimed at enhancing the understandability, flexibility, and maintainability of object-oriented designs. These principles serve as guidelines for developing robust and adaptable software architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID principles can be described briefly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Single-responsibility principle: \"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.\" In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Open–closed principle: \"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Liskov substitution principle: \"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.\" See also design by contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interface segregation principle: \"Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dependency inversion principle: \"Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.\"[Wikipedia]\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance (object-oriented programming)\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that allows objects or classes to be based on or derived from other objects or classes. It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where new classes (subclasses or child classes) inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (superclasses or base classes). When a child object is created through inheritance, it inherits all the properties and behaviors of the parent object, except for constructors, destructors, overloaded operators, and friend functions specific to the base class. Inheritance offers several benefits, including the ability to build upon existing classes, define new implementations while preserving desired behaviors (interface realization), reuse code, and independently extend the functionality of the original software using public classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance and subtyping are distinct concepts and should not be conflated. While there are languages where inheritance and subtyping align, there are others where they differ. Subtyping primarily establishes an \"is-a\" relationship, whereas inheritance focuses on reusing implementation and establishing a syntactic relationship. It's important to note that inheritance does not guarantee behavioral subtyping or a semantic relationship. To differentiate between these concepts, subtyping is sometimes referred to as interface inheritance (although it may also involve specialization of type variables), while the type of inheritance described here is known as implementation inheritance or code inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subtyping\n",
    "In the realm of programming language theory, subtyping (also referred to as subtype polymorphism or inclusion polymorphism) represents a type of polymorphism where a subtype is a data type that is connected to another data type (known as the supertype) through substitutability. This implies that program elements, such as subroutines or functions, which are designed to manipulate elements of the supertype, can also manipulate elements of the subtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping\n",
    "\n",
    "## Singleton Class\n",
    "In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a singular instance. The pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the singleton pattern allows objects to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1- Ensure they only have one instance\n",
    "    2- Provide easy access to that instance\n",
    "    3- Control their instantiation (for example, hiding the constructors of a class) \n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes' relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to take all of the properties of another class and apply them to our own. The parent class is the one from which the attributes and functions are derived (also called as Base Class). Child Class refers to a class that uses the properties of another class (also known as a Derived class). An Is-A Relation is another name for inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation\n",
    "Aggregation is a concept in which an object of one class can own or access another independent object of another class. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1- It represents Has-A’s relationship.\n",
    "    2- It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship. For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.\n",
    "    3- In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition\n",
    "Composition is a type of Aggregation in which two entities are extremely reliant on one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1- It indicates a relationship component.\n",
    "    2- Both entities are dependent on each other in composition.\n",
    "    3- The composed object cannot exist without the other entity when there is a composition between two entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Association\n",
    "Association is a connection or relation between two separate classes that are set up through their objects. Association relationship indicates how objects know each other and how they are using each other's functionality. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many.\n",

    "# Exercises\n",
    "in this part all the excersizes will be anwered.\n",
    "## Exercise 1: The factory\n",
    "1- What is a factory?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a factory is an object responsible for creating other objects. In a formal term, it refers to a function or method that returns objects of a varying class, from some method call, which is assumed to be \"new\". The factory pattern allows for dynamic object creation and provides flexibility in generating instances of varying classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, HsmrParserFactory.py is a factory that can create two different objects from two different classes called HsmrTextParser and HsmrPdfParser, and it is called by HsmrReportHandler.get_ccs_info(). \n",
    "\n",
    "This factory can build an object from different classes at a time; consequently, one can conclude that the utilized design pattern in this program is Factory Method pattern (based on Wikipedia description of different design patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Does the implementation of the factory method follow the Interface Segregation Principle?\n",
    "\n",
    "in general term and based on the following link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46512199/factory-method-pattern-solid\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method pattern, being a creational pattern, is primarily responsible for object creation. It is not directly associated with the Interface Segregation Principle. The Interface Segregation Principle focuses on designing lean and logically grouped interfaces, avoiding the creation of fat interfaces where clients are compelled to implement unnecessary methods. While the Factory Method pattern deals with object creation, the Interface Segregation Principle concerns the design and organization of interfaces to ensure clients have access to only the methods they require.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Single reponsibility\n",
    "In this question each class is evaluated individually to see that whether it adheres Single Reponsibility Principle (SRP).\n",
    "\n",
    "CcsClassification:  does not strictly adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It has multiple responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Reading and temperarily storing the CCS classification information from a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Containig methods to check for the presence of a PDF key column, add a PDF key column to the DataFrame, and retrieve formatted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- defining three static methods that returns three different columns from the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "CcsHospitalDataExtracter: appears to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It has a single responsibility, which is to extract and process CCS data from hospital reports. Here's an overview of its responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Identifying and fetching HSMR reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Reading and saving HSMR reports in a temporary directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Making plot from CCS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "CcsHospitalInfo: adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It has a single responsibility, which is to encapsulate and provide access to the CCS information of a single hospital. The responsibilities of this class is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Storing and accessing CCS information of a single hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Extracting some information and statistics from CCS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Creating a CSV file of CCS information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- retrievibg CCS information fram a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "FileDownloader: adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It has a single responsibility, which is downloading a Pdf file from a url and saving it in a temporary directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "GoogleCustomSearchApi: adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It has a single responsibility, which is to perform a custom Google search and process the results to find the URL of an HSMR report PDF file. The responsibilities of this class is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Performing a google search.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Searching for HSMR Pdf file.\n",
    "\n",
    "HsmrReportsFetcher: follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). it fetches the HSMR reports from the website's of the hospital based on Google search of the official hostpital sgc codes. The responsibilities of this class is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Fetching the information of agb code from the official data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Findinf and downloading HSMR reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "HsmrReportHandler: follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). it Handles the parsing and extracting of the CCS information. The responsibilities of this class is as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2- Reading and parsing HSMR reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- getting HSMR file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "LocalSettings: it is quite hard to deretmine whether this class follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). However, I believe that this class does not follow the Single Resposibility Principle (SRP). While this method is responsible for three different responsibilities, it is worthy to say that they are related to each other. However, this cannot be a good reason to say that this class is only responsible for a task. The responsibilities are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Loading settings from a json file\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Providing access to the settings\n",
    "\n",
    "3- making a new instance of __LocalSettings class, which is a singleton class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotter: follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) since this class is only responsible for creating and showing a plot based on provided data.\n",
    "\n",
    "HsmrParser: does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This class is responsible for following reponsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Checking some features of the file (HSMR report).\n",
    "\n",
    "2- creating a text file with the content of the parsed file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- extracting CCS information from the parsed file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- containing a method for raising an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "HsmrParserFactory: follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) because it provides a factory method to get the HSMR parser object based on the parser types defined in parser_types.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "HsmrPdfParser: follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) since it is a child class whose responsibility is to parse HSMR pdf files.\n",

    "\n",
    "3- Providing methods to access the retrieved data in different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "AgbCodeData: adheres the Single Resposibility Principle (SRP) since it is only responsible for saving and supporting the datatable that keeps the AgbCode data.\n",
    "\n",
    "TestFileDownloader: determining the adherence of this class is quite challenging, but I think this clas does NOT follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This is true that this class contains only one method, but this method is responsible for diffetent seperated tasks. the responsibilities are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Testing downloading Pdf from a URL.\n",

    "\n",
    "TestGoogleCustomSearchApi: adheres the Single Resposibility Principle (SRP) since it is responsible for testing GoogleCustomSearchApi class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: The base classes\n",
    "To answer this question, it is better to start with the number of base classes. Even though the question explicitly mentions 'In the code, several base classes are used.', I was not able to find more than one base class, which name is 'HsmrParser'. For the mentioned based class, TWO subclasses can be detected: HsmrPdfParser(), HsmrTextParser(). the mentioned derived classes have read_file() method that has the responsibility of reading a file and parsing the required data from that. These two classes seem to ahere Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) since they can be used interchangeably with the base class. Also, they are not the cause of any conflict in the code. They provide their own implementation of the abstract method read_file(). So, the substitution of HsmrParser with its subclasses (HsmrPdfParser and HsmrTextParser) is possible without affecting the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4. The local settings object\n",
    "\n",
    "A- Search for the Settings class. What makes this class a singleton object and is a singleton object SOLID?\n",
    "\n",
    " LocalSettings.py contains a singleton class called __LocalSettings(). The reason that this class can be assigned as a singleton class is that it can only produce a single object that cannot be parsed or changed during the runtime of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, Singleton design pattern can follow SOLID principles or not. It depens on programmers to abide to these principles. but regarding this class, the way of implementing LocalSettings() and __LocalSettings() does not seem to adhere all the SOLID principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "1- The first principle Single Resposibility Principle (SRP) is not adhered by this class. Because, this module is assigned to complete two responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Open-Closed Principle (OCP): while this class was not used as a base class for other classes, it seems that one can properly extend this class by adding subclasses instead of modifying it as it focuses on loading and accessing settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle cannot be evaluated directly on this module as it does not have any subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Interphase Segregation Principle (ISP): this class does not involve in any interphase, so we cannot explicitly evaluate the module for this principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): this class violates the mentioned principle as it depends on utilities function rather than an abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "B- The hospital types codes are stored in a python module hospital_types.py. Is this a logical solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I think it can be a logical way to store hospital types since it is easy to change, use and maintain by different clients or users. it can be a good way to centralize and manage the hospital types as this file can be used like a configue file. \n",
    "\n",
    "C- Is there an alternative solution for these kinds of local settings and parameters? Please elaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course in my opinion, using Singleton class in this specific situation is a complex solution for a simple problem since the programmer can use a configue file to preserve all the setting information and it can be changed easily by different clients.\n",
    "\n",
