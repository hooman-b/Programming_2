    "# An Introduction to Asynchronous Programming in Python\n",
    "Asynchronous programming is a type of parallel programming in which a unit of work is allowed to run separately from the primary application thread. When the work is complete, it notifies the main thread about completion or failure of the worker thread. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Processes\n",
    "One of the ways to program paralelly is the use of multiple processes. From the terminal, you can start your script two, three, four…ten times and then all the scripts are going to run independently or at the same time. The operating system that’s underneath will take care of sharing your CPU resources among all those instances. Alternately you can use the multiprocessing library which supports spawning processes as shown in the example below."

    "After creating and starting multiple child processes using the start() method, the main process iterates over the list of procs (which contains all the child processes) using a for loop. Inside the loop, the join() method is called on each process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The join() method blocks the execution of the main process until the respective child process finishes its execution. By calling join() on each process in the loop, the main process waits for all the child processes to complete before moving forward.\n",

    "asyncio is the new concurrency module introduced in Python 3.4. It is designed to use coroutines and futures to simplify asynchronous code.\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio uses different constructs: event loops, coroutinesand futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An event loop manages and distributes the execution of different tasks. It registers them and handles distributing the flow of control between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Coroutines (covered above) are special functions that work similarly to Python generators, on await they release the flow of control back to the event loop. A coroutine needs to be scheduled to run on the event loop, once scheduled coroutines are wrapped in Tasks which is a type of Future.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Futures represent the result of a task that may or may not have been executed. This result may be an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Asyncio, you can structure your code so subtasks are defined as coroutines and allows you to schedule them as you please, including simultaneously. Coroutines contain yield points where we define possible points where a context switch can happen if other tasks are pending, but will not if no other task is pending. A context switch in asyncio represents the event loop yielding the flow of control from one coroutine to the next."
